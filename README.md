# Stripe + Firebase/Google Cloud Platform Demo

This is a proof of concept demo project for running a event-driven payment
workflow using Google Cloud Functions and Stripe.

## Getting Started

The easiest way to get started is to run this demo in [Cloud Shell](https://cloud.google.com/shell/),
a Google Cloud Platform tool providing you command-line access to your cloud
resources directly from your browers.

If you are a Firebase developer, click here to start:

If you are a GCP developer, click here to start:

Alternatively, you may also set everything up locally with the steps below:

1. [Set up your Python development environment](https://cloud.google.com/python/setup) (for running the example app).
1. Set up [Google Cloud SDK](https://cloud.google.com/sdk/) or
[Firebase Coomand-Line Tool](https://github.com/firebase/firebase-tools).
2. Follow the steps here to continue ([Firebase](firebase_tutorial.md)
or [GCP](gcp_tutorial.md)).
